# Burger Tracker!

A bootcamp assignment to create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Built following the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to store, query and route data, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.  jQuery, Google Fonts and ionicons were also used in app production.

### About

* Burger Tracker! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

### User Story

    AS A user, I want to be able to keep track of burgers I want to eat and ones I have eaten

### Build

* In HTML, semantic tags have been used to aid with accessibility.
* The site is built using a Bootstrap CSS framework.
   * The use of Bootstrap minimises the need for media queries. 
   * See [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/) for more information.
* [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/) powers the dynamic rendering of the html content based on user input.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) supplied custom fonts.
* [ionicons](https://ionicons.com/) is used to add custom icons.
