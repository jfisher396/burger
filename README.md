# Burger Tracker!

A bootcamp assignment to create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Built following the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to store, query and route data, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.  jQuery, Google Fonts and ionicons were also used in app production.

## About

* Burger Tracker! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

## User Story

    AS A user, I want to be able to keep track of burgers I want to eat and ones I have eaten
